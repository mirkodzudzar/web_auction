# Short introduction

## While installing this app localy, you can:

- run db: seed command to populate Database with random data.
- default user could be 'mirko@test.com' with 'password' as a password.
- or you can register on your own.

Then you are ready to go: 
- each item will expire in 10 days and it's status will be changed to 'sold' or 'expired' if there are no buyer users.
- we can bid for any item that is not our own, we can only cancel bid once.
- any user that is registered is able to publish a new item, as well as cancel existing item.
- user profile can be edited.
- you can see all you items, bought items as well as sold ones.
